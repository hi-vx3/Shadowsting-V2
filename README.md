# ShadowSting-V2

ShadowSting-V2 is an advanced multi-stage attack framework inspired by USB Rubber Ducky.  
It combines HID injection, HTA execution, PowerShell payloads, network interaction, persistence, and evasion techniques into a single sequential chain.

## Features

- **Stage 1 – HID Injection**: Execute keystrokes, mouse events, and command input.  
- **Stage 2 – HTA Loader**: Load and execute chained PowerShell scripts.  
- **Stage 3 – PowerShell Payload**: Multi-layer execution for system info, network, and files.  
- **Stage 4 – Network Interaction**: Data transfer, remote communication, and conditional logic.  
- **Stage 5 – Persistence Layer**: Establish scheduled tasks and maintain long-term access.  
- **Stage 6 – Evasion Layer**: Stealth techniques including process hiding and encryption.
